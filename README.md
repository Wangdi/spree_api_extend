SpreeApiExtend
==============

A couple quick additional methods on the api to better support JS MVC frontends.

- Create users (don't have to be an admin) @ /api/users. Returns api key in response
- Login users via POST /api/sessions w/ json: "{ session: {email: "email", password: "password"}}"". returns api key in response.
- Get current order & user @ "/api/status"
- get /api/orders w/ a logged in 'non-admin' user will return all orders belonging to that user.

CAUTION
------------
These modifications are changing the default spree authorization for the api that could introduce security issues.  Be sure you look through the changes before you do anything productiony!
